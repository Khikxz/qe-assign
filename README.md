My assignment output uses html for the markup, css for styling, and javascript for some interaction.
I also used the SimpleLightbox library via cdn to view images in a gallery as slides.

My main challenges for this assignment are the given time, and to create a website from scratch or without template/design to follow. I based my output from OneQuantum Philippines website, but on Sunday the said website was not available so I checked the OneQuantum website for additional references. I believe I could do more than what I created when in right circumstances
